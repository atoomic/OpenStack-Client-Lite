# DESCRIPTION

OpenStack::MetaAPI

Using OpenStack::MetaAPI you can call routes from any service directly on the main object.
Helpers are defined from the specs defined https://developer.openstack.org/api-guide/quick-start/#current-api-versions

Currently only a very small part of the specs have been imported to this project.

This software is currently in `PRE-ALPHA` stage... use it at your own risk!
Feel free to report issues to the Bug Tracker or contribute.

# Available functions / methods

## new( \[ Arguments for OpenStack::Client::Auth \] )

Create one OpenStack::MetaAPI object.
For now all arguments passed to `new` are used to create one [OpenStack::Client::Auth](https://metacpan.org/pod/OpenStack::Client::Auth).

## $api->flavors( \[ %filter \] )

List all flavors from the compute service. \[view synopsis for some sample usage\]

## $api->servers( \[ %filter \] )

List all servers from the compute service. \[view synopsis for some sample usage\]

## $api->floatingips( \[ %filter \] )

List all floatingips from the network service. \[view synopsis for some sample usage\]

## $api->security\_groups( \[ %filter \] )

List all security\_groups from the network service. \[view synopsis for some sample usage\]

## $api->image\_from\_uid( $image\_uid )

Select one image from its UID. \[view synopsis for some sample usage\]

## $api->image\_from\_name( $image\_name )

Select one image from its name. \[view synopsis for some sample usage\]

## $api->create\_vm( %args )

Create one server from one image with one floating IP, wait for the server to be ready.

```perl
    my $vm = $api->create_vm(
        name     => 'SERVER_NAME',
        image    => 'IMAGE_UID or IMAGE_NAME',   # image used to create the VM
        flavor   => 'small',
        key_name => 'your ssh key name',         # optional key to set
        security_group => 'default',    # security group to use, by default use 'default'
        network => 'NETWORK_NAME or NETWORK_ID',    # network group to use
        network_for_floating_ip => 'NETWORK_NAME or NETWORK_ID',
    );
```

## $api->delete\_server( $server\_id );

Delete a server from its id. Note floating IP linked to the server are also deleted.

# TODO

- refactor/clean existing prototype
- increase API Specs defintion
- plug methods to route from API Specs
- helper to purge unused floatingips
- helper to purge unused servers
- increase POD & add some extra examples
- POD for using filtering: using RegExp, ...
- improve filtering on the request when described by the specs
